## Commandline utilities
The commandline utilities (ask, query and answer) expect C&C to be installed in a folder called `candc` in the working directory they are called with.

## Webservice
Run `python ./sparql-client/webservice.py` form the base directory and look at http://localhost:8080/. Note that the webservice requires Python 2.7 and won't work yet with Python 3. Sorry!
